Description:
This project is a React-based web application that displays a list of numbered courses in card format, allowing users to filter the courses by specific categories such as Development, Business, Design, and Lifestyle. The app is designed to provide a simple and user-friendly way to browse through various types of courses while offering dynamic filtering based on the course type.

Key Features:
Course Listing: Displays courses as cards, each showing course details like title, description, and type.
Course Filtering: Users can filter courses based on categories (Development, Business, Design, and Lifestyle), with real-time updates.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
State Management: Utilizes the useState hook to handle the application's state, such as filtering and managing course lists.
Side Effects Handling: Leverages the useEffect hook to fetch or update course data and handle side effects when required.
Toast Notifications: Integrates the react-toastify package to provide user feedback with notifications, making interactions more engaging and informative.
Icon Integration: Uses the react-icons package to add visually appealing icons, enhancing the user interface.
Easy-to-Use Interface: The app provides a clean and intuitive design, making it easy for users to explore and filter courses.
Technologies Used:
React: For building the user interface and handling state management.
React Hooks: Specifically useState and useEffect for managing state and side effects.
React-Toastify: For displaying toast notifications to inform users of actions like filtering.
React-Icons: To add visual appeal with icons across the interface.
CSS: For styling the application and ensuring a responsive design.
Learning Outcomes:
Enhanced understanding of how to implement React hooks (useState, useEffect) in a practical project.
Improved skills in integrating third-party libraries like react-toastify and react-icons.
Simplified toast notifications creation, overcoming previous challenges faced during college projects.
Strengthened ability to build dynamic filtering functionality based on user interaction.
